# VOT Tradings — Web Client

React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 client for the VOT Tradings gateway (`cmd/main_gateway`). Real login/register gate an eight-page shell matching the platform's target IA — see [Current scope](#current-scope) for what's real vs. pending backend.

## Setup

```bash
cd web
cp .env.example .env   # point at your running gateway if not the default
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requires the Go gateway running and reachable (default `http://localhost:8080`), with `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in the gateway's `.env` including this app's origin (default `http://localhost:5173`) — the gateway also needs `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` for the session cookie to survive the cross-origin fetch, which it sets automatically for allowed origins.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — dev server with HMR
- `npm run build` — type-check (`tsc -b`) then production build to `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — serve the production build locally
- `npm run lint` — Oxlint

## Brand tokens

Defined in `src/index.css` via Tailwind v4's `@theme`: `--color-canvas` (#0B0E14), `--color-surface` (#1A1D26), `--color-elevated` (#242936), `--color-fg` / `--color-fg-muted`, `--color-bull` (#0ECB81), `--color-bear` (#F6465D), `--color-accent` (#3B82F6). Generates standard Tailwind utilities (`bg-canvas`, `text-bull`, etc.) — no separate `tailwind.config.js` needed under v4's CSS-first config.

## Structure

- `src/pages/` — `Login`, `Register`, `Profile`, `Dashboard`, `Funds`, `Market`, `Trade`, `Forecasts`, `Reports`, `Settings`, routed in `App.tsx`
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` — real session state (`login`/`register`/`logout`, current `user`); checks `GET /api/v1/auth/me` on load
- `src/context/PortfolioContext.tsx` — shared poll of `/healthz` + `/api/v1/balance`, mounted only inside the authenticated layout (polling before login would just 401 on repeat)
- `src/components/layout/ProtectedRoute.tsx` — redirects to `/login` when `useAuth()` has no user
- `src/hooks/usePolling.ts` — the underlying fixed-interval polling hook
- `src/hooks/useAlpacaStream.ts`, `useOandaStream.ts`, `useInference.ts` — **stubs**. Each always returns `{ connected: false, reason: 'not_implemented' }`; they exist as the landing spot for real streaming/inference work later, not as working data sources today
- `src/components/layout/` — `NavBar` (shows the logged-in user's email + logout), `AppLayout`, `ProtectedRoute`
- `src/components/ui/` — `Card`, `StatTile`, `StatusBadge`, `NotConnected` (the "this feature has no backend yet" panel used throughout Market/Forecasts/Trade)
- `src/components/charts/AllocationDonut.tsx` — per-broker USD allocation, computed from the gateway's `equity_usd` field (never a client-side guess at FX conversion)
- `src/components/trading/BrokerAccountCard.tsx` — per-broker connected/error card
- `src/lib/api.ts`, `src/lib/types.ts` — typed gateway client (every call sends `credentials: 'include'` for the session cookie); keep in sync with `internal/httpapi/`

## Current scope

| Page | Status |
|---|---|
| `/login`, `/register` | Real — backed by `internal/auth` (bcrypt + Redis sessions), not a cosmetic form |
| `/profile` | Real — shows the signed-in user, and lets them connect/disconnect their own Alpaca/OANDA/Questrade credentials (`POST/DELETE /api/v1/broker-credentials`), encrypted server-side |
| `/dashboard` | Real — NAV, cross-border split, allocation chart from the authenticated user's own `/api/v1/balance`. Shows an explicit "no brokers connected yet" prompt instead of a blank screen when the user has none — no internal infra status (Postgres/Redis/etc.) is shown here, that's not user-facing information |
| `/settings` | Real — broker connectivity audit from the same endpoint |
| `/market/:symbol` | Real on-demand quote lookup (`GET /api/v1/quote`) against one of the user's connected brokers — a REST snapshot, not a stream. Candlesticks/L2/indicators below it show `NotConnected` |
| `/trade` | Real — cash-by-currency, and a real order ticket (`POST /api/v1/orders`) gated behind an explicit "this may execute a real trade" confirmation checkbox. TWAP/VWAP/RL-routing options show `NotConnected` |
| `/funds` | Real external links to each broker's own funding portal — deposits/withdrawals aren't reimplemented in-app, deliberately (see root README) |
| `/forecasts` | Layout only — needs the Python DL engine (`services/dl_engine`, currently empty) |
| `/reports` | Real order history table (`GET /api/v1/orders`). P/L statements show `NotConnected` — needs historical price data to mark positions against |

Nothing in this app fabricates data for a feature the backend doesn't support — see each page's `NotConnected` panels for exactly what's missing and where. The order ticket on `/trade` is the one screen that can move real money if a connected broker points at a live account — its confirmation checkbox exists for that reason, not as friction for its own sake.
